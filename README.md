# 2ellipses-and-beyond

You can generate a pair of concentric ellipses from two concentric circles.
The goal of this project is to generate a generic algorithm to do so, and then see what happens when it is fed 2 concentric ellipses, and whatever comes after that.


Idea for this project came from the Senior Math Research course at RPI.
